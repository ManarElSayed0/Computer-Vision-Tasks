1-The methods used:
a-Erosion and Dilation of images using OpenCV in python
b- Thresholding techniques using OpenCV  (Simple Thresholding,Adaptive Thresholding,Otsu Thresholding)

2- Explain each method ..
a-Erosion:Erodes away the boundaries of the foreground object,Used to diminish the features of an image.
b-Dilation:Increases the object area,Used to accentuate features
c-Simple Thresholding:a global value of threshold was used which remained constant throughout
d-Adaptive Thresholding:is the method where the threshold value is calculated for smaller regions. This leads to different threshold values for different regions with respect to the change in lighting
e-Otsu Thresholding:a value of the threshold isnâ€™t chosen but is determined automatically


3- The new thing is:
the different types of thresholding
