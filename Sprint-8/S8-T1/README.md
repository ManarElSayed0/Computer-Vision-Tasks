*The Methods Used:
a-install OpenCV for Python
b-concepts of OpenCV
    -Reading an image
    -Extracting the RGB values of a pixel
    -Extracting the Region of Interest (ROI)
    -Resizing the Image
    -Rotating the Image
    -Drawing a Rectangle
    -Displaying text
c-Reading an image in OpenCV using Python
d-Arithmetic Operations on Images using OpenCV
   -Set-1 (Addition and Subtraction)
   -Set-2 (Bitwise Operations on Binary Images)

*Explain each method:
a-installing OpenCv:To install OpenCV, one must have Python and PIP, preinstalled on their system.PIP is a package management system used to install and manage software packages/libraries written in Python.
b-concepts of CV:PIP is a package management system used to install and manage software packages/libraries written in Python,it contain may concepts as Reading image,Extracting the RGBvalue of a pixel,Resize the image, Rotating the image,Drawing a Rectangle
c-Reading an image in OpenCV using Python:here we open an image using OpenCV
d-Arithmetic Operations on Images using OpenCV:


*The new method is:
Arithmetic Operations on Images using OpenCV
   -Set-1 (Addition and Subtraction)
   -Set-2 (Bitwise Operations on Binary Images)
