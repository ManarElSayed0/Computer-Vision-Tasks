*The methods used:
a-Image Resizing using OpenCV 
b-Image Processing in Python (Scaling, Rotating, Shifting and Edge Detection)
c-Image blurring using OpenCV

2- Explain each method ..
a-Image Resizing using OpenCV:Image resizing refers to the scaling of images,t helps in reducing the number of pixels from an image and that has several advantages
b--Scaling:Scaling operation increases/reduces size of an image
-Rotating:Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise
- Shifting: Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference
-Edge Detection:detecting sharp edges in the image. This edge detection is essential in context of image recognition 
c-Image Blurring:refers to making the image less clear or distinct. It is done with the help of various low pass filter kernels

3-The New Thing is :
Image Processing using python
