1-The methods used:
a-Play a video using OpenCV
b-Extract images from video in Python
c-Face Detection using Python and OpenCV with webcam


2- Explain each method 
a-Play a video using OpenCV:To capture a video, we need to create a VideoCapture object. VideoCapture have the device index or the name of a video file. Device index is just the number to specify which camera. If we pass 0 then it is for first camera, 1 for second camera so on. We capture the video frame by frame
b-Extract images from video in Python:Image Analysis is a very common field in the area of Computer Vision. It is the extraction of meaningful information from videos or images. OpenCv library can be used to perform multiple operations on videos
c-Face Detection using Python and OpenCV with webcam:his project utilizes OpenCV Library to make a Real-Time Face Detection using your webcam as a primary camera.
