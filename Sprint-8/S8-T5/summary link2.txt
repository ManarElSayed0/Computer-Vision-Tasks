-Computer vision is a field of study focused on the problem of helping computers to see,subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning
-Computer vision is distinct from image processing,computer vision system may require image processing to be applied to raw input
-challenge of computer vision ,Computer vision seems easy,because it is so effortless for humans
-first challenge is that we donâ€™t have a strong grasp of how human vision works,Another reason why it is such a challenging problem is because of the complexity inherent in the visual world
-Computers work well for tightly constrained problems, not open unbounded problems like visual perception
-this is a list of some high-level problems where we have seen success with computer vision:
  -Optical character recognition (OCR)
  -Machine inspection
  -Retail (e.g. automated checkouts)
  -3D model building (photogrammetry)
  -Medical imaging
  -Automotive safety
  -Match move (e.g. merging CGI with live actors in movies)
  -Motion capture (mocap)
  -Surveillance
  -Fingerprint recognition and biometrics
