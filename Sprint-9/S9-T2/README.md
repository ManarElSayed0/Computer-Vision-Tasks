1- The Methods used:

a-Template matching using OpenCV in Python
b- Face Detection
c-Circle Detection

2- Explain each method ..

a-Template matching:is a technique for finding areas of an image that are similar to a patch(a small image with certain features).

b-Face Detection:detect object of interest(face) in real time and to keep tracking of the same object

c-Circle Detection:inds a variety of uses in biomedical applications, ranging from iris detection to white blood cell segmentation

3-The Template matching and the Circle detection were new
