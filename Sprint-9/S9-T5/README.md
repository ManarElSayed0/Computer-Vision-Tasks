1- What ’re the methods that you used:

a-Creating Python Virtual Environment in Windows and Linux
b-Python Virtual Environment 
c-Create virtual environment using venv
d-Using mkvirtualenv to create new Virtual Environment
e-Detect an object with OpenCV

2- Explain each method:
a-Creating Python Virtual Environment in Windows and Linux:is a python environment, that is an isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without affecting other projects
So basically it is a tool that enables multiple side-by-side installations of Python, one for each project
b-Python Virtual Environment:is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most of the Python developers use
c-Create virtual environment using venv: A virtual environment, here, is an isolated Python installation that allows to manage dependencies and work on separate Python projects without affecting other projects
d-Using mkvirtualenv to create new Virtual Environment:o use the  mkvirtualenv command you need to have virtualenvwrapper installed which is nothing but a set of python extension commands
e-Detect an object with OpenCV:OpenCV is the huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems
